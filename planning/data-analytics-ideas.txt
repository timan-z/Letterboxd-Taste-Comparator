Ways to sort data:
1. Average rating (sort by ascending/descending average across all users)
2. Rating discrepancy/variance
3. User-specific sorting (ascending/descending)
4. Sort by highest # of users who all gave it the highest possible rating.
5. Sort by film title (alphabetically)

Ways to filter data:
1. Show only films all users rated >= specific threshold
2. Show only films all users rated <= specific threshold
3. Show films where a specific user rated them >= or <= specific threshold
4. Minimum/maximum average rating (where all profiles rated them >= or <= specific threshold).

Some analytics ideas:
1. Taste Alignment Score (compute pairwise correlation or cosine similarity between users)
2. Ratings Heatmap (Table View: Rows = Films, Columns = Users, Cells = colour-coded ratings)

NOTE: Going to put off analytics for now. Since this was meant to be a small-scale side project to learn Golang
in the first place, just going to have a frontend page get started first where I can apply the sorting and filtering
functions. After that, I can start thinking about analytics and how I can render a Ratings Heatmap etc with maybe an
external framework or something.
