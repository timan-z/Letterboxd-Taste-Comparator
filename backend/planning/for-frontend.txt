UI ideas for once I get to writing the frontend:
- Multi-select input for Profile URLs:
-- Can have like just two but then there's a "+" button you can click to add another text-input box (for URL input) up to a max of 6.
- Table View of mutualFilms (or I was thinking maybe like a list or something you can scroll through)
-- You should be able to search via film with some text bar...
- Filter/sort panel on the side:
-- Sliders for min/max rating
- Toggles like: "Only 4.0+ avg" (but you can scale that too and also do like "2.0- avg")
- Ability to toggle display between:
-- Raw table
-- Ratings heatmap
-- Discrepancy graph (e.g., bar of rating spread)

[FOR LATER]:
For my README, when I host this on GitHub. I will have put valuable work into this project. So, if the Letterboxd site HTML structure
drastically changes and bricks my scraping code, something that I should do is have .CSV upload option -- where I can throw in data and 
skip the scraping part altogether, and jump straight to the sorting/filtering/analytics that you see above.
