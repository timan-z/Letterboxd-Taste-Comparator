ADDITIONAL THINGS:
- Because I opted for TanStack Table to generate my table, it admittedly may have made the majority of my functions in filters.go and sorting.go redundant, becuase the table will take care of the sorting all by itself. Regardless, it's still worth keeping in the file just because why not.
^ Keep my original CLI version of the scraping logic somewhere in the backend code so you can visit and use it...

 LITTLE BUGS TO FIX LATER:
- I made my TanStack table header "sticky" but when you scroll vertically downwards, there's a little horizontal gap between the top of the table and the top of the header where you can see through it and thus the posters when you scroll. I want to fix this at some point but it's not worth the time to expend at this moment...
