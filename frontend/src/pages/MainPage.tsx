you can use. It'll just be a button that says "Use Dummy Info" and when you click it, it expands a box with
the profile URL links for my six Cahiers du Cin√©ma archival accounts.

This should be moved to the "About Me Page" after, but these dummy accounts will be a preventative feature
for the scenario where the official Letterboxd page HTML DOM is radically transformed, and my Go-based scraping
logic fails. My counter-measure would be using these Dummy Letterboxd accounts (**my own** accounts) and manually
storing their rating data within the project directory somewhere, then -- and I'll need to adjust my Go code for this --
when their specific URLs are encountered, instead of any scraping, that dummy data is used instead.

{/* [3] - The third <div> will be the "Output Area" table and I guess I'll need to think more about how I'll have everything work.

So it'll be a table that displays a vertically scrollable list of all the mutual films rated by the input list of users.
- Each row will be for a film (w/ film title, poster, rating from each user, official avg rating, input avg rating, and variance. Also link to LB page ofc).

I obviously want it so that this table is interactable. I want a search-bar that lets you dynamically filter the table in
real-time and view films based on string search (keep it simple, just limit this to the title displayed on LB itself).
- Then I obv want (dropdown?) buttons (and sliders?) for the Sorting/Filtering features of the site.
- You can sort by [1] Average Rating (input) [2] Variance [3] Title [4] User Rating (DEBUG: maybe also official rating? We'll see).
- You can filter by [1] Threshold above [2] Threshold below [3] USer-specific filters
*/}

{/* [4] I've left out the Heatmap but below the output table, maybe have a "Generate Heatmap" button
and I can have it generate in the <div> below. (Look for some framework out there that can make a heatmap on the fly). */}
